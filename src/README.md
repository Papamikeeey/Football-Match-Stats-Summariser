# 🏟️ Match Stats Summarizer Program in Rust 🦀

We meet again 🦹🏽! I thought out and crafted this project 💼 from the ground up to ingrain my understanding 🧠 of Structs 🏢 , implementation blocks within structs and more handy stuff... Oh and it combined my love for football ⚽️ in the process lol!
---



This is a 🛠️ tool that crafts out 🧠 insightful and aesthetic summaries for games played at the pinnacle of the beautiful game ⚽️!
Includes the following details;


- Data for teams involved
- Goals scored
- Outcome of the game
- Key stats e.g. possession, shots & chances created
- Critical insight - Expected Goals (xG) that calculates likelihood of scoring using shots, chances created 
- Team Grade - Smartly calculates grade from A .. D based on key performance metrics
- Attendance data on number of fans within the stadium
- Stadium data
- Current timeline


## 📋 TODO (Future additions...)

- [ ] Add JSON ouput option
- [ ] Tag on CSV export
- [ ] Add CLI arguments to add dynamism in running the program
- [ ] Add more detail in the case of knockout tournaments
- [ ] Add printed league table with teams
- [ ] Add visuals in terminal for a more aesthetic feel and better understanding
